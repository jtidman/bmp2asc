<p><font size="-1">Why?</font>
<p><font size="-1">This tool is used to import company or regulatory logos,
or other graphical elements into the PADs database. These images can then
be placed on the silkscreen, or any other layer.</font>
<p><font size="-1">How?</font>
<p><font size="-1">This tool will scan a windows BMP (two color only) file
and convert it into a PADs .ASC file format. This file can then be imported
into the design database. In scanning the BMP file, a left to right, top
to bottom approach is used. Each continuous group of white pixels is translated
into a single line segment in the ASC file.</font>
<p><font size="-1">What is the best method to use?</font>
<p><font size="-1">Any two color, black and white BMP file can be converted.
However, for best results, please use the following method (we&#146;ll talk
in Mils, and try to show examples):</font>
<p><font size="-1">First, determine the size of the area on the PCB for the
picture:</font>
<p><img SRC="../BMP2ASC/image6.gif" height="388" width="579">
<p><font size="-1">This image size is 1600x800 (Quite large, actually. Most
areas for logos will be much smaller).</font>
<p><font size="-1">Next, find the picture that you want to put in that area.
If you have a graphic designer generating the image, tell him/her to create
it using half the area measured (800x400), and to use only white and black
(dithering and colors don&#146;t look good when translated to silkscreen). We&#146;ll
use a picture with some text:</font>
<p><img SRC="../BMP2ASC/image7.gif" height="200" width="400">
<p><font size="-1">I would like to take this time to plug my favorite tool
for the graphical work: PaintShop Pro. You can get it from <a href="http://www.jasc.com/">http://www.jasc.com/</a>.
This is a useful tool for grabbing images from the screen, converting them
to black and white, scaling them to fit and saving them in windows bitmap
format.</font>
<p><font size="-1">Once this bit map is saved in 2 color mode, we run the
program with the following arguments (assuming the program and the bit
map are in the same directory):</font>
<p><tt><font size="+1">BMP2ASC input.bmp output.asc 2 26 0 0</font></tt>
<p><font size="-1">This will scan the data and convert it to horizontal lines
2 mils wide. These lines will be placed on layer 26 (silkscreen top), and
the lower left-hand corner of the image will be at 0,0.</font>
<p><font size="-1">Next open up a new PADs file, and import the ASC file.
Be sure to set the color and the minimum display width:</font>
<p><img SRC="../BMP2ASC/image8.gif" height="496" width="418">
<p><img SRC="../BMP2ASC/image9.gif" height="473" width="548">
<p><font size="-1">Select the complete item, and then combine it. This may
take a while for complex images. Once complete, select save to library
from the mouse right-click menu.</font>
<p><font size="-1">You can now past it in to existing designs using the paste
from library button bar:</font>
<p><img SRC="../BMP2ASC/image10.gif" height="402" width="622">
<p><font size="-1">And, the final results:</font>

useful. If you find it useful, please send me an email, just to let me
know (I can then send updates, if you would like). I cannot guarantee any
support, but if you have problems, need help or want to suggest improvements,
let me know.</font>
